# Todo-list-with-React
This simple React project illustrates the parent-child component interaction <br/>
and the integration of Bootstrap in a React Project.<br/>
I used a LocalStarage to save the `to do items` in the browser.

## Todo-list user story
- I can add a task
- I can mark as `checked` all the completed tasks
- I can switch tasks from completed to uncompleted, and vice-versa
